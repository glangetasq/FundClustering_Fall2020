Observation for 2018 results:
  - The number of funds in the main clusters differ greatly: one main cluster
has only one fund, while another has more than 5,600 funds!
  - Idea to fix that: subclusterize a lot more main clusters with a lot of funds,
(and maybe not subclusterize main cluster with sub 10 funds?)
