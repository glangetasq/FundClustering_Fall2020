Misconception:
  - We are currently using holding data as a Timeseries data:
      this is wrong, we are using December holding data for a given year.
      this is still static data

Problem for implementing other algorithms:
  - We are using KMean, and it cannot handle other distances than euclidian
  - To use other algorithms than KMean could be tricky as we are both making new
    clusters (if an outlier is in a cluster) and merging similar clusters into
    one, based on qualitatitve tests using holding data.
    Cannot be used for TS holding data or other type of data.
