- High priority:
    - Two Layer model fit method: use the Pipeline pattern. May need to change how the second layer is coded.
    - Test if full model works. Need to run it on GPU (see collab)
    - Create notebook to show the workflow.
    - [DONE] Separate the args parser of the hyper parameter to a specific class and easy initialization. See args method of the Two Layer class
    - Once everything is done, configure the FundClusterFactory (add the model to the CLUSTER_CLASS_CONFIG dict)
- Medium priority:
    - First layer model output method: output result to csv, save model to pickle
    - Second layer model output method: output result to csv (maybe? It’s the same output than the full model actually…) save model to pickle
    - Two Layer model output method: output result to csv, save model to pickle
    - [organization] Separate the Autoencoder classes for the second layer class to its own folder rather than Tools
    - [organization] Create a metrics folder to measure the layers performance (already metrics.py in tools)
- Low priority:
    - Model summary of each class: save statistics of convergence, statistics to measure the model, hyper parameters of the models.
    - Remove some useless self.variable (for instance I think the self.features of the second layer is not used)
    - Move the ‘iterative kmean’ algorithm in first cluster to a separate model.
